# rbenv-gel

Install [Gel](https://github.com/gel-rb/gel) as an [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) plugin, transparently using the Rubygems and Bundler compatiblity layers with all your Ruby versions.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gel/rbenv-gel.git "$(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-gel"
rbenv rehash
```

## Usage

Use `gel` commands directly, and any other commands invoked via rbenv shims you use like `rake` will also use Gel instead of Rubygems or Bundler.
